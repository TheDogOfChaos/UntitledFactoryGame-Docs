            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/b708a8e2ed0899f91011293ff569f0a04473ee96" target="_blank">b708a8e</a>] -
            In the beginning, there was not much. Just me, a guy with a dream idea for a game, and a vague idea of how to pull it off. Just like I had with my <a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/libGDX-uiTest" target="_blank">UI project</a>, I wanted to make things in Java, specifically in the LibGDX engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/37f94cb2265abcd04b147b029019ae67ebda4efc" target="_blank">37f94cb</a>] -
            So, I used the project generation tool of LibGDX and got right to work, attempting to create a Hyperlap2D scene (but failing miserably because I didn't know what the hell I was trying to do) and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21208050/22702897" target="_blank">copying in a reliable noise class for use in the world generator that I was going to make</a>.
            The noise generator worked beautifully, so it stayed. The Hyperlap2D scene got removed 5 commits later.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/abb6f4145c1863b8fe1c4a9d429b4988e5015d46" target="_blank">abb6f41</a>] -
            This is where the player arrived, just a basic Player class with a blank method, a texture, and a xcf file (a project file for GIMP) of my spritesheet at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/527b73a85edf71aebafd7fb1972eb9a97c62dc71" target="_blank">527b73a</a>] -
            I got my main game class ready for future work, somewhat idiotically undoing the work I had already done in my Player class, expecting that I'd be making my Player into an actor on a stage (via Scene2D).
            I then tried to (unsuccessfully) make a tilemap for my game via Tiled, expecting that I was going to need it.
            This commit also introduced the starting point of the actual WorldGenerator class, but at the time, it was literally just completely random numbers corresponding to a tile to draw onscreen.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/64126a8aea1b63e561ef72b342baec1180f2fdc3" target="_blank">64126a8</a>] -
            Here, as the commit describes, I sourced some assets and code from the tests directory of the LibGDX repository. This was mainly to figure out how I could try and achieve a dynamically generated tilemap.
            I also updated my spritesheet and added a sprite atlas file, and a spritemap file of which I cannot remember the purpose of.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/26d97a4e38333014a83888bb44062fa1cee2fb36" target="_blank">26d97a4</a>] -
            Here is where the Hyperlap2D and Tiled tilemap files said goodbye. I also moved the world generator to its own class, which is honestly a better way of doing things.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/2c4346b64efe4c6785efd31fd99f7a65abdef4aa" target="_blank">2c4346b</a>] -
            I added the files for MetalUI, a Scene2D.UI skin that I liked, and thought would work well. I also tried to properly set up the WorldGenerator class to, yknow.. <i>actually</i> generate a world, simultaneously setting up my main FMPGame class in the process such that it would load and render the map, and adding in a Scene2D.UI text button for easy regeneration of the world.
            The class worked, but the button didn't, and I foresaw some problems that could've arisen later down the line with the fact that it only generated the part of the floor that wasn't under walls, so i decided to try and rewrite it after this so it generated an ENTIRE floor, even underneath walls.
        </p>
        <p>
            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/3deede1fa9112f56913f10485f923768e9749991" target="_blank">3deede1</a>] -
            I replaced the default tile atlas with my own, which.. also worked.
            I also moved the restart button to a keybind (the Space key, to be precise) and created a LoadNewMap method in the world generator, which (much like you'd expect) loaded a new world.
        </p>

            Here I unsuccessfully attempted to make my WorldGenerator generate the floor.

            Here's where I did a MASSIVE rewrite of the entire WorldGenerator, now making it use a tile atlas to set the different areas of a 3-dimensional array to images that will then be drawn (but in a later commit)
        </p>

            Here I got the assets that i was working on in earlier commits into a square atlas for easier access later down the line.

            Massive commit, and a massive success. I made it so that the renderer draws every layer of the map over the last, and implemented a selector for the different noise types (in case I ever wanted to <span class="big">[PLEASE FINISH THIS]</span>

            Added a main menu (with no functionality).

            Made the main menu start button functional.

            Complete rebrand from FMPGame to UntitledFactoryGame.

            Eliminated some if-else chains intelligent, and added some more functionality to the main menu.
            Game can now be actually exited.

            Added a basic player with basic movement but NO collision detection.

            Actually registered the InputHandler because I forgot to in the previous commit.

            Tried to implement a Vector-based movement system instead of just incrementing the player's pixel position.

            [<a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/UntitledFactoryGame/commit/a3cf4007b771cfd0992f316046a04b7ff92b0c6c" target="_blank">a3cf400</a>] -
            Reverted some bad decisions and implemented the Player's movement speed as a variable, for easy changing by in-world events & other things to that effect.

            Massive changes, and the beginning of me using multi-level inheritance to my advantage.

            An attempt at Box2D, where I set up the world, player, InputHandler, and attempted to make wall colliders for the walls of the map. (<a href="https://libgdx.com/wiki/extensions/physics/box2d" target="_blank">Box2D is very popular physics library, originally built for C++ but implemented in LibGDX as an extension via a thin Java wrapper</a>)

            Added debug information akin to Minecraft's F3 Screen.

            Implemented wall collisions. They didn't seem to align properly at the time, but that was due to an oversight that I found later.
        </p>
        <p>

            Attempted to add a physics body loader and define my own shapes for use in my game because I thought the player collider had rounded corners (it didn't, but again, I found that out later.)
        </p>

            Here I attempted to implement a lighting system, because that was what appealed to my ADHD brain at that point in time. I shelved it soon afterwards.

            Here was where I shelved the lighting system, but also where I got the camera following the player properly.

            More player building art, and preparations for the building system, alongside some de-boilerplating.

            Semi-Proper implementation of the build menu (it renders, but functionality is not implemented yet). Again, my ADHD brain took the wheel (probably because this was getting a bit stagnant for me), and I decided to try my hand at making music, for some reason.

            More work on the building menu. It works, and can dynamically add buttons based on an array of 'Blocks' objects

            The ADHD Strikes Back: Tried to implement a Named Binary Tag system for easier data storage about blocks, even though I did not have the time to do so.
