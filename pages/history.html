            In the beginning, there was not much. Just me, a guy with a dream idea for a game, and a vague idea of how to pull it off. Just like I had with my <a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/libGDX-uiTest">UI project</a>, I wanted to make things in Java, specifically in the LibGDX engine.
        </p>

            So, I used the project generation tool of LibGDX and got right to work, attempting to create a Hyperlap2D scene (but failing miserably because I didn't know what the hell I was trying to do) and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21208050/22702897">copying in a reliable noise class for use in the world generator that I was going to make</a>.
            The noise generator worked beautifully, so it stayed. The Hyperlap2D scene got removed 5 commits later.

            This is where the player arrived, just a basic Player class with a blank method, a texture, and a xcf file (a project file for GIMP) of my spritesheet at the time.

            I got my main game class ready for future work, somewhat idiotically undoing the work I had already done in my Player class, expecting that I'd be making my Player into an actor on a stage (via Scene2D).
            I then tried to (unsuccessfully) make a tilemap for my game via Tiled, expecting that I was going to need it. This commit also introduced the starting point of the actual WorldGenerator class, but at the time, it was literally just completely random numbers corresponding to a tile to draw onscreen.

            Here, as the commit describes, I sourced some assets and code from the tests directory of the LibGDX repository. This was mainly to figure out how I could try and achieve a dynamically generated tilemap. I also updated my spritesheet and added a sprite atlas file, and a spritemap file of which I cannot remember the purpose of.

            Here is where the Hyperlap2D and Tiled tilemap files said goodbye. I also moved the world generator to its own class, which is honestly a better way of doing things.
        </p>

            I added the files for MetalUI, a Scene2D.UI skin that I liked, and thought would work well. I also tried to properly set up the WorldGenerator class to, yknow.. actually generate a world, simultaneously setting up my main FMPGame class in the process such that it would load and render the map, and adding in a Scene2D.UI text button for easy regeneration of the world. It worked, but I foresaw some problems that could've arisen later down the line with the fact that it only generated the part of the floor that wasn't under walls, so i decided to try and rewrite it after this so it generated an ENTIRE floor, even underneath walls.

            I replaced the default tile atlas with my own, which.. also worked. I also moved the restart button to a keybind (the Space key, to be precise) and created a LoadNewMap method in the world generator, which (much like you'd expect) loaded a new world.
