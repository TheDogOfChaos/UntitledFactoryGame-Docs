            In the beginning, there was not much. Just me, a guy with a dream idea for a game, and a vague idea of how to pull it off. Just like I had with my UI project, I wanted to make things in Java, specifically in the LibGDX engine.

            So, I used the project generation tool of LibGDX and got right to work, attempting to create a Hyperlap2D scene (but failing miserably because I didn't know what the hell I was trying to do) and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21208050/22702897">copying in a reliable noise class for use in the world generator that I was going to make</a>.
            The noise generator worked beautifully, so it stayed. The Hyperlap2D scene got removed 5 commits later.

            This is where the player arrived, just a basic Player class, a texture, and a xcf file of my spritesheet at the time.

            I got my main game class ready for future work, somewhat idioticly undoing the work I had already done in my Player class, expecting that i'd be making my Player into an actor on a stage (via Scene2d).
            I then tried to (unsuccessfully) make a tilemap for my game via Tiled, expecting that I was going to need it. This commit also introduced the starting point of the actual WorldGenerator class.
